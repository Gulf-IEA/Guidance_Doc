### Creating a new Quarto Book & Repo

There are several ways to do this which are well outlined in chapters [15](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first), [16](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-first), and [17](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last) of [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/).

To be able to use the Quarto Book template when creating a new project, so that all the necessary files are included I followed these steps.

1.  Create a New Project in RStudio

2.  Choose "New Directory" to see a list of possible formats

3.  Select "Quarto Book"

4.  Enter the name of the project (will eventually become your repo name) and make sure it is in the correct directory.

5.  Click "Create a git repository" before making the project.

6.  Stage and commit the files the files that are part of the Quarto Book template (can alter later)

7.  Create a repo on GitHub by running usethis::use_github() in the console

    -   To add the quarto book to the Gulf IEA organisation I added the organisation="Gulf-IEA" argument

    -   If you have already used RStudio with GitHub it will know your account and should know where to go

8.  This create a new repo on GitHub as the origin and opens the repo in your browser
